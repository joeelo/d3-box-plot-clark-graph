# d3-box-plot-clark-graph

## Purpose

To make Math fun! Put in some random numbers, and watch the graphs on home and `/dotplot` route go crazy! It can be difficult to grasp the Box Plot, what interquartile ranges are and how to get outliers from those ranges. The dotplot though simpler is still really fun to watch! All the graphs were written in native D3.

## To run locally
